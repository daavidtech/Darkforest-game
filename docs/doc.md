## Unit

Unit construction takes some amount of resources and population. After construction these units have certain maintanence cost. Units are movable and can move by themself. One unit can be for example:
- One kokobongo with glub. Which only require one population per unit.
- Something like [Contubernium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contubernium_(Roman_army_unit)) which has few soldiers and requires something around 8 population.
- Tanks which might require around 4 population.
- Battleship which might require 100 to 1000 population.
- Big spachips tink of something like in starwars where they might be thousands to hundereds of thousands.

Units have basic state and then they can be trained for more advanced roles like engineer or doctor. Upgrades to different units have various requirements like simple rifle squad require units with basic military training but something like battleship might require chefs, engineers, doctors... Some upgrades to units have some requirements like certain age or IQ level.

Units can have multiple upgrades but obviously it is costly and might not make sense. Upgrades like new education are not cancellable but things like riffle squat and be dismantled and units like tanks could give resources if dismantled but obviously less than was used to build them.

## Battles

Even though game speed is speed up considerably speed up time is relevant in the battles for example units have different attack ranges which means certain type of unit can attack other type units farther away. Units will respond automatically to attack by attacking it if they can see it. Basically it measn that with acher attacks swordman then it would be logical that swordman will run to the archer but some missile is launched from 50km or more away how could some simple riffle squad know how to attack enemy which they cant see.

Battles are always onesided meaning that they are simulated from point of view of the attacker but both players are attackers if units are in attack range. Battle is cosidered to be started only when distance is less or equal than attack distance.

### Damage

Things that affect damage done to the enemy unit are:
- Attack damage
- Accuracy
- Enemy unit defense stat which is different to different damage types
- Attack speed

## Currency
There is no single currency players can create their own or choose to use existing ones. Value of the currency is determined by the player based on how much there is it and population and exchange rates.

Factories can use money to give assign value for the resource they are producing.  This allows unifactories to efficiently obtain resources for factories.

## Map
One grid rectangle is 10 meters

One mapgrid size could be 10 000 km2 so around 1 000 000 rectangles.

With unit speed of 8 kmh it would take around 1400 hours to go through the whole map.

Map can have different types of areas like sea or areas which have high natural resources like oil or other minerals.

One map grid presents one planet and there can be map grids with different sizes. Players can only leave their map grid when they develop required technology to do so.

### Space

Maybe space could be three dimensional map grid where structures need to be placed on three dimensions

## Speed

It would be fun if the game time would have realistic time but it would be just speedup by x amount. However in real life difference between movent speed and building speed is quite high. For example if school building 8 month and the we would speed up time by 1000 then building this building would take few hours and going through the whole map would take 1 hour. 

## Building

Building buildings require resources and workers. Also requires certain Technology stage. Buildings may also require certain vehicles for building like building modern big building without any machines would be very slow.

Buidings have some dependecies like:
- Resources like stone, metal....
- Specialiced unit like teachers, engineers..
- Innovation level
- Building units

Buildings can be upgraded but then thet might require more specialiced units, recources and higher maintanence cost.
