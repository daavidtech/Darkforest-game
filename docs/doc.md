## Unit

Unit construction takes some amount of resources and population. After construction these units have certain maintanence cost. Units are movable and can move by themself. Units can ride vehices which allows them to move faster.

## Vehicle

Vehicles can be used for faster movement or other cababilities like more attack damage or faster building time. Vechicles are not independed and using them requires units with certain kind of training. One vehicle can move zero or more units.



## Currency
There is no single currency players can create their own or choose to use existing ones. Value of the currency is determined by the player based on how much there is it and population and exchange rates.

Factories can use money to give assign value for the resource they are producing.  This allows unifactories to efficiently obtain resources for factories.

## Map
One grid rectangle is 10 meters

One mapgrid size could be 10 000 km2 so around 1 000 000 rectangles.

With unit speed of 8 kmh it would take around 1400 hours to go through the whole map.

## Speed

It would be fun if the game time would have realistic time but it would be just speedup by x amount. However in real life difference between movent speed and building speed is quite high. For example if school building 8 month and the we would speed up time by 1000 then building this building would take few hours and going through the whole map would take 1 hour. 

## Building

Building buildings require resources and workers. Also requires certain Technology stage. Buildings may also require certain vehicles for building like building modern big building without any machines would be very slow.

## Units

Building units require some resources and
